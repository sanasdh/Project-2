# Project 2 - Summary

FindYourMakeup is a web application used to help the user find his/her product easier while having the chance to look at similar products as well. Then the user can add the product to her wishlist and/or view it on the brand's website. This application was created as my second project of the General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive (SEI) Program.
# Technologies Used
This web application is built based on:
NodeJS
Express
MongoDB - The database is hosted on MongoDB Atlas
the web application is hosted on Heroku.

# Getting Started
You can find the web app deployed at Heroku [HERE!](http://projectgasei2.herokuapp.com/).

# Next Steps
1. Improve the user experience:
  1. Add socket.io for live chat, and better customer service
  2. Add username in the reviews
  3. Add the wichlist button in the "show.ejs", so the user don't need to go to detail page
2. Improve the CSS/ Design aspect:
  1. Change the font
  2. Make the website responsive
3. Improve the search
  1. if the user couldn't find the specific product, the web application should suggest semilar products, or products that the user would be interested in!
